While Faraj  1 resolve the problem of securing data, it doesn't touch on the problem of anonymity. The two parties would need to use the public internet to share decrypted message, thus, it would be known who contacted whom. Using Tails OS along with Tor can further obscure tracking, no evidence   

## The pillars of anonymity 

- It shall be able or possible to start without pre sharing public keys
  - No sharing of public keys through public internet
- It cannot be P2P 
	- Due the easiness of tracking
- It should be irrelevant if the other party is not trust worthy, or is not following pillars of faraj 1 
	- The metadata other party receive, shall not allow for reverse
- It is invitableÂ that it's going to be ineffeincnt and that is okay, as we are optimizing
-  The more the machine has to do, the less trust worthy the process
