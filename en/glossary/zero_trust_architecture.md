title: What is Zero Trust Archticture
description: Zero trust architecture is framework or a set of roles to be followed when building a network or a service that is public internet facing

Before the advance of internet, wi-fi networking, and cloud computing. When the only way to connect to the public internet was through plugging that cable.  At that it used to be acceptable, that to rely on network location in order to determine access control. 

e.g. if you are connecting to LAN network of a company in the office,  you have access to the resources of the network.

However with the advance of cloud computing, wifi networking, ip spoofing, hybrid setup (where companies have both on-premisis and on cloud resources), thus trust out to be inefficient, and insecure to determine one access based on their location on the network. 

The Zero Trust Architecture, is a response to above concern, where each request to access a resource has to be verified, and is by default considered outsider or attacker.
