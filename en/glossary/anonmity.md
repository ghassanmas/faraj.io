Anonymity in context of browsing the internet, is about browsing the internet without leaving any footprint (or trying to?).  

Anything a user do online leaves a digital fingerprint, which could be used to reveal true identity of the user.  

One of the  main reason Tor browser or network built is to hide the identity of the user, however one cannot be sure that even when using Tor browser their identity is completely hidden or unknown.
