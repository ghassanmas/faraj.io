title: An overview and Why 
---


In this world, where it become easy to communicate with anyone, anywhere. This convience, easinesss comes with a cost. (a non finicail cost), it's **Privacy**, and for some of us, like journalits, or actvisits, it could mean their life or survival[^1].

How can I just send a messge securely,  a very simple straighforward quesition. This initiatve is just about answering that. 

 > Convience is enemey of privacy

On the other hand, the easier it is to do, the more venruablae it is. Thus might not be releavnt for most readers, however it important to have the "How?", avaiable for the general public.



 > For cryptographic  to be inseucre (as an algrothim), then all of mathmatician have failed us as as general public.  
 
## How 


Playtype:

- state on state 
- state sponsered companies on people 
- people on people

### Actors

**Entity types**: e.g. aramature, state sposnered, companies..etc, companies dedicated for that 
**Motive**: Money, influence, power, espoige, public order, allgedgy national secutiry
**How/Method**:
- Utizling miss usage, user unablity 
- In depth research utizling unknown venrablity (case of corps) OR back door 

Structure 
- Short intro about limitation/an overview (the What) 
- The goal (The why)
   - Explain the actors, thier motives, thier target
   - All the stack holders 
- Thier Methods of which (some are legal or illegal)
  - Hgih usage base 
  - Follow digital print and other data left when using servoces
     - Cooperation between setate and other coprs (e.g state with ISP)
     - Corps are obligated to provide access when asked (they have to respect local reulgation)
  - Abuse vulnerabilities  (zero day )
- Their Motive (depends on the actor, companies: money, state: control or shape public opinion )

### Why I should trust this 

 - You don't have to, this intended to be as a resource for the public, if you find a mistake, uncorrect. Please submit an issue or just (you will be credit if you want to)
 - I try to list resources of which this is based on. 

### Should we trust online resources of  goverments 

There has been incidents, of which governments tries to implement a backdoor, this is not longer a secret. 

Last point: 

Please remember softwares or application might have malfucntion, insecure, but algorithm don't. Cryptography is based on principles of prime numbers, which haven't been broken yet. If it was, then we as public not suppose to trust mahmatician.

> For crytographic to be inseucre (as an algrothim or math concept), then all of mathmatician have failed us as general public.  

If you still don't trust it (as math concept), then proof it's wrong may be?[^2] 

Lastly, again even if math is not broken, software might be and usually is, that's  where physics comes in. When transmitting data
